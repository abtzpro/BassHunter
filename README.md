# BassHunter
BassHunter takes in local audio from microphone and attempts to pinpoint the source of loud and abusive bass music with gps. 

You know the story, ages old as it is. That one nieghbor, that one edgy guy with his 15's, we've all been there.

Well no more! With BassHunter, you can finally pinpoint the source of that pesky Bass Music using GPS. 

BassHunter was designed for those that may need it. To hopefully bring peace of mind, and peace in general to the user.
